# TourneyPro

## Getting Started
This web application uses the following independent technologies which require installation.
- imagemagick
- Elasticsearch

To run the client, go into the directory by doing `cd front`. Install the dependencies by doing `npm i`. Before you start the project, the client requires a unique key for each user. To generate them, simply run `sh create-env.sh` or `./create-env.sh` into a bash terminal. Next, to build the app, do `npm run build` and once that is done, do `npm run start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
